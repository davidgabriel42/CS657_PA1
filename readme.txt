/*
Readme file for main.cpp.

To compile, use g++ command directed at the main.cpp. On my system, no
libraries needed to be installed in order to compile. No special compiler 
operands are necessary to produce a executable a.out file. 

Call the a.out file from the bash shell to launch the interactive command
interface. Pipelines and redirects not currently supported. 

Any questions can be sent to contact@david-gabriel.com and I will respond 
at my earliest opportunity.
